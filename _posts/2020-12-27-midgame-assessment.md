**Goals: For the Future**

I'm 26 going 27.

I got 3 more years of my 20s left.

I doubt that I have anything figured out yet, but I can list some minor accomplishments here.

Out of my personal goals, I'm steadily making progress. One needs to pace oneself, I am hoping that slowly and surely I'll check all the boxes.

On another note, learning about the universe is a constant. I am enjoying it. In the process, I have learned some lessons.

As a man stood up, I'll carry the torch for the next generation.
