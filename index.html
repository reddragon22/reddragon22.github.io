<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> Hi I'm Joe. I'm a computer science student studying at The University of Alabama. I'm currently on the cusp of my career. I believe myself to be smart and hardworking, but am humbled by my lack of knowledge and experience especially when considering the seemingly infinite amount of expertise each individual has on the world's stage. Despite the challenges, I feel a calling to carve out my own niche in order to leave a long and lasting positive impact on all those who I can, within my ability, reach. I hope to live my life thoughtful of the past, feeling in the moment, and foolishly optimistic about the future. I'm not sure what lies ahead of me but am ready to move forward. </p>

<h2> Projects </h2>
<p><strong> FlavorTown </strong></p>
<p> FlavorTown is a CS senior project designed and implemented by a group of 4 students including me. This project was particularly rewarding because, aside from certain deliverables, it alloted us a great of amount of self direction to put into practice everything we learned as a student. Aside from having a voice in critical decisions relating to the project, having the most experience on the team, I saw my own role as a lead developer, who pushed through many proof of concepts code from which my teammates expanded upon.</p>

<p><strong> Myriad </strong></p>
<p> Myriad is an project which primarily showcased User Experience design philosophies. As a contributer to the project, I feel that I had a big role in shaping the vision and look of the application. My role in this application was much more geared towards data collection and finding the right material for our application to showcase </p>

<p><strong> Adtran End of Term Presentation </strong></p>
<p> Much of the work I've done for Adtran is proprietary but I am able to provide the Power Point Slides which I used to present my work at the end of my time at Adtran</p>
