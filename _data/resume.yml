personal_statement  :     Hello, my name is 徐冠舟, but you can call me Joe! A Computer Science professional who studied @ The University of Alabama; on the cusp of professional career; inquisitive, laidback, but driven. Thoughtful of the past, feeling in the moment, and foolishly optimistic about the future.

about               :     Born in the far East (China), raised in the Southwest (Phoenix), studied in the deep South (Alabama) - a lifelong student and a curious soul.
