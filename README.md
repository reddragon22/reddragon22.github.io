# Hello Everyone!

I'm Joe and this is going to my website for awhile. Things is still very much UNDER CONSTRUCTION, but I'll try to make good progress...

## The Older Website

I'm the type of person who hates throwing away old code, so here is a link to my [Old Website](http://xuguanzhou.com/OldResumeSite). It was my venture into pure HTML.
It was one of my first websites at the time but, but at least you can download my resume off of the site.

## About

This page was built on a [Freelancer](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/) Bootstrap template. I really liked it, so I thought I modify it for my own purposes. The project itself is under a MIT license, so defiantly go check them out.
