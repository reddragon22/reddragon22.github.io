# Xu Guanzhou's Website
A personal website that has allowed me to sharpen my "full stack" capabilities.
Website uses Jekyll on the frontend and LAMP on the backend.
More features to come, as long as I have to time.

# Front End
The design of this website uses Jekyll/Bootstrap on the front.
Most of the webdesign is handcrafted with html and css.
The style is credited to someone else.

# Hosting/Backend
This website is now hosted on a digital ocean droplet - LAMP backend.
(used to be a github page; maybe will migrate to amazon S3)
Uses "git hooks" to sync everything.

# About
This site should contain:
* My resume
* Some samples of my portfolio
* My blog containing my thoughts
* A way to contact me
