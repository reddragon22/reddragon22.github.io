# Xu Guanzhou's Website
*A personal website that has allowed me to sharpen my "Full Stack" capabilities
*This website showcases a large extent of my coding/design/engineering capabilites
*Built with an rotation class of various technologies I've come across and wish to try
*More Feature surely to come...

# Front End
*I use Jekyll to generate the blog posts
*I do "handcraft" my own templates using CSS, HTML5, and Bootstrap
*I credit the artistic inspiration to a fellow computer scientist

# Hosting/Backend
*This website is now hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet - modeled off of LAMP software architechture
*Originally hosted as an github.io page
*Potentially will migrate over to Amazons/Google's Cloud contingent upon pricing
+Thinking about using wraping the whole thing on top of an DOCKER
+The site is currently small enough to function on top of any server anyways

# Git Hook Methology
*Automatically Depoly the website after pushed
*Need SSH access to deploy@138.68.255.148
*git remote add deploy deploy@138.68.255.148:~/auto_deploy.git
*Makes deploying the website much more simple
